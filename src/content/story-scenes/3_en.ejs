      Day 4 on the Intergalaktika

      After four slices of pizza I’m completely full. The buffet is really good
      — I can’t even imagine how insane the food in first class must be.

      This morning I showed that new person a few hacking things. After that I
      went to the games area. There’s always something going on there and I
      don’t feel so alone. Two boys tried their hand at holo chess, but they had
      no clue what the rules were.

      I don’t know. Maybe I could teach them? Should I go over and ask something
      like: “Hey, we don’t know each other, but I’d like to explain the rules,
      because I can’t stand watching you move the pieces around pointlessly?” 🙈
      No idea… maybe some other time.
